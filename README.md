# math-cpp

This is an attempt at a small, header-only C++ math library for use in
Computer Graphics. It aims to provide basic primitives, such as Vectors,
Matrices and Points that are useful in any work related to graphics.

It is currently very much work in progress and mostly untested. Even if if
was complete, it would still probably be wiser to use more battle-tested
libraries, such as [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) or
[Terathon Math](https://github.com/EricLengyel/Terathon-Math-Library) in your
projects.

## Implementation status:
- [x] Vector types
- [x] Tests for Vector types
- [ ] Point types
- [ ] Tests for Point types
- [ ] Matrix types
- [ ] Tests for Matrix types
- [ ] Useful constants
- [ ] Useful functions
- [ ] Basic transforms (Rotate, Translate, Scale)
- [ ] Camera transforms (Perspective, Orthographic projection)
