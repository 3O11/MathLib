This is a a small, header-only C++ math library for use in Computer Graphics.
The core of the library is implemented and its interface is most likely
stable at this point. However, things may still change at any point without
warning, because the library is still not well tested and bugs or unfortunate
design decisions may force changes in the future.

Any questions, comments, criticism, bug reports, feature requests or pull
requests are welcome. Please use the GitHub issue system for this purpose.

Proper documentation of the library will be made available in the future,
but it is small and simple enough for the implementation itself to act as
"documentation" of sorts.
